Hello!

My name is Alanna Mellor and I am an undergraduate student at the Shidler’s College of Business, University of Hawaii at Manoa. I was raised entirely in Hawai’i and I am currently pursuing my Bachelors of Business Administration in both Management of Information Systems, as well as International Business (double major). My expected graduation date is Fall 2024, and my immediate career goal is to work for a multinational travel corporation to support company missions with a specific regard to technology and information systems. 
Fueled by my natural interest in global business, culture, travel, and technology, I believe this pathway will provide me with a deep sense of fulfillment and purpose. This is not to mention the propelment of my curiosity, which is sure to come with my continuous exposure to various cultures and business customs. Finally, by realizing the value of technology in the modern business climate, I have determined that I can become a tremendous asset to any establishment by maintaining a deep understanding of information technology as well as global business practices. I firmly believe that my ambition and hard work will guide me through this path. 

Thank you!
