<p> Assignment 2 required me to add a login and registration page to my e-commerce website. The general layout of the site is that consumers should be able to view and browse products upon entry. If theyâ€™d like to purchase an item, they should be directed to a login page. If the user does not have an existing account, they should have the opportunity to register a new one. Upon logging in, the user should get directed to a receipt of their purchases. A link to what I will be reflecting upon in this essay, can be found <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html">here</a>.</p> 

<p> This assignment did very well in teaching me how to maintain transient data through several pages. This came into play when I was required to store the quantities that the user had selected throughout the login and registration processes, all the way to invoice. I also learned quite a bit about writing data into new files. This is useful in cases where you want the data to become permanently stored. Finally, I also developed my abstract thinking skills. I learned that it is less about the code that you write, and more about the planning that goes into completing each task.</p>

<p> In this assignment, I chose to work independently. All of the work presented is a product of my own thinking and capabilities.</p> 

<p> In times of trial, I accessed help via the internet. I became very thorough in my research and utilized a vast amount of online resources to aid me in my progress. I also frequently referenced the assignment 2 code examples provided by my professor. Throughout this project, I found that I needed most help with passing transient data through a variety of virtual processes. </p>

<p> Developing this assignment differed from Assignment 1 in that it required me to think more in depth about my design, as opposed to simply building a framework for my site. The code implemented was less than Assignment 1, but was certainly more complex, clever and efficient. </p>

<p> In total, I spent approximately 40% of my time planning, 30% of my time adding new code, and 30% of my time testing and debugging my application. </p>

<p> Throughout this project, I think I did very well in keeping my code organized and ensuring that each line has a definitive purpose. Simultaneously, I often struggled with overthinking and overcomplicating tasks. </p>

<p> If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would stick to my first train of thought in every instance. I found that my gut instinct was typically correct (and usually more simple) than any of the various rabbit holes that I often found myself falling down. </p>
