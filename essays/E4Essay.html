  <p>With the Spring 2023 nearing an end, I’ve been given the opportunity to reflect on my progress and all that I’ve learned in Information Technology Management (ITM) 352. My programming skills have improved drastically. Not only have I become more familiar with the fundamentals and syntax of JavaScript, but I have honed my ability to think analytically and provide logical solutions to abstract problems. I’ve loved becoming immersed in this world of technology because it’s made me aware of the creative side that programming can offer.
On this note, there is always room to improve. I must learn to not overthink challenges. When presented with a problem, it would be wise for me to trust my gut instinct and entertain the first idea I have. I’ve learned that most times, things are not as complicated as they seem. 
With reference to how the class material has helped me progress in programming, the WODs (“workout of the days”) have helped me tremendously. For most of them, I had to push myself and really study how and why I would implement each line of code. This practice of intentional programming has contributed to me becoming more mindful of my actions. To add to this, the labs have also helped me learn, and I believe that I am able to complete them with a high degree of confidence. Especially now that I have completed Assignment 1, I feel ready to tackle Assignment 2. It is not likely that I will complete this assignment with ease, but I will definitely approach the task with perseverance and resilience. 
Reflecting now on the format of the class, I believe that intensive pace has pushed me beyond my comfort zone and has challenged me to test the boundaries of what I thought I was capable of. For this, I am extremely grateful. The aspect of the course that has helped me most is definitely working one-on-one with the professor, as well as collaborating with classmates.</p>
